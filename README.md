# My_Portfolio
This is my Portfolio using pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is my hosted Web URL: https://dineshikasivapalaraja.github.io/My_Portfolio/

There are eight sections. About, Academic, Experience, Extra Curricular activities, Projects, Skills, contact and Interests, and Hobbies. In academic, and extracurricular activities there is a toggle function used to hide those on the main page. But viewers can see those sections by clicking those in the navigation bar. Then only it will be visible to the viewer.
Also, the web page's responsiveness screen size is limited to 400 px to 1200 px. There is a short responsiveness issue. I hope other functionalities work well.
